        <p>This is a post by Tutorial Team Member Julian Meyer, a 13-year-old python developer. You can find him on Google+ and Twitter.
                Have you ever wondered how video games are created? It’s not as complicated as you might think!
                In this tutorial, you’ll create a simple game called Bunnies and Badgers, where the hero, the bunny, has to defend a castle against an attacking horde of badgers.</p>
                
        <p>To write this game, you’ll use Python. No, I’m not talking about a big snake! 
                Python is a computer programming language. We chose Python for this tutorial because it’s a simple language to start out with, and is fun and easy to learn.</p>
                
        <p>If you are new to Python, before you begin check out this book: Think Python: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist. That should get you up to speed.
                Then dive back here and get ready – there’s a war coming on between the bunnies and the badgers. Keep reading to jump into the fray!
